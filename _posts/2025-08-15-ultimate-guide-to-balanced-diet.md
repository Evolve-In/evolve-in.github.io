## What is a Balanced Diet?
A balanced diet is one that provides your body with all the essential nutrients, vitamins, and minerals it needs to function at its best. It's not about restriction, but about getting the right proportions of:

* **Macronutrients:** Carbohydrates, Proteins, and Fats.
* **Micronutrients:** Vitamins and Minerals.

### Key Components
1.  **Lean Protein:** (Chicken, fish, beans, tofu) for muscle repair.
2.  **Complex Carbs:** (Oats, brown rice, quinoa) for sustained energy.
3.  **Healthy Fats:** (Avocado, nuts, olive oil) for hormone health.
4.  **Fruits & Vegetables:** For essential vitamins and fiber.
