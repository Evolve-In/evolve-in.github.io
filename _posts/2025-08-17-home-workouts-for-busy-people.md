## The Challenge: No Time
We get it, life is busy. Between work, family, and social commitments, finding time for the gym can feel impossible.

### The Solution: Effective Home Workouts
You don't need a gym to get a great workout. Here’s a simple routine you can do anywhere:

1.  **Warm-up (5 mins):** Jumping jacks, arm circles.
2.  **Circuit (Repeat 3x):**
    * 20 Bodyweight Squats
    * 15 Push-ups (or knee push-ups)
    * 20 Lunges (10 each leg)
    * 30-second Plank
    * 15 Glute Bridges
3.  **Cool-down (5 mins):** Stretching.

This entire workout takes less than 30 minutes and hits all your major muscle groups.
